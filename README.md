# COMP593-regex
Me messing around with regex. Some may find it entertaining.

The multi-clone.py script is to read a folder of assignment submissions received from D2L, extract the URL to GitHub, then clone the repo in a folder under the student's assignment folder. The assignment is received as a folder containing one folder per submission, which is very convenient for a script to iterate over each folder.

I wrote it as a practical demonstration of scripting: a small program that helps you get your work done. "Eating your own dog food", as the expression goes.
